                    <p>Once you have clicked on it, a scroll will pop up, allowing you to draw on it and follow
                        the Kanji tracing lines.

                    <p>You can click on the right and left arrows to switch to a different page for that Kanji. This will
                        let you study different meanings for that Kanji.

                    <p>Click on the clear button if you would like to erase your writing.</p>

                    <p>Now, you can click on which Kanji you would like to quiz over, if you would like to quiz over all of the Kanji of this chapter, then you can click on the Select All button.</p>
                    <p>You can click on a Kanji again if you have changed your mind about quizzing over that Kanji, or click the cancel button if you have decided not to quiz at all.</p>
                    <p>Once you have finished choosing which Kanji you would like to quiz over, click the confirm button.</p>
                    <p>The scroll will pop up, and you'll be presented with a blank scroll, and some English and Hiragana.</p>
                    <p>Given the English and Hiragana equivalent translations, write the corresponding Kanji out onto the scroll. You can check your answer by clicking the Check button at the bottom of the scroll.</p>
                    <p>Once you have checked your writing, you can try that page again using the Try Again button, or move onto the next page by clicking on the right arrow.</p>
                    <p>Once you have reached the end of the quiz, the scroll will close and you will be done!</p>

                <p>This website was developed by Kenneth Le. At the time of this website's creation, I'm a sophomore at
                    UT Austin taking 610D Japanese. I made this website to assist
                    students learning Japanese, and as a student myself, I know how
                    difficult Kanji is to memorize the meaning and how to draw it.
                    I found myself often being able to recognize the meaning of each Kanji when
                    I see it, however, if I was asked to write it out, then I would suddenly be lost.
                    I hope that this website will help you draw Kanji!

                    functions would help convenience or help the learning process, then please, email me.
